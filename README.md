## Knife Juggler

Knife Juggler is a library designed to let you to do unsafe things with Scala.

Many people turn to Scala for its type safety, its rules that prevent users
from writing code that could fail at runtime. They would prefer to be warned
when code might fail in some cases, even if it will succeed in many others.

Other users find these kinds of safeguards restricting. They prefer to live
dangerously, eschewing bike helmets, seatbelts, and climbing harnesses. They
would rather shoot first and let the runtime sort things out. This library is
for them.

### Foreward
